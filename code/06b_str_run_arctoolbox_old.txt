In this step the you need to run an ArcToolbox in ArcGIS. The Toolbox is provided upon request. 
Use the building footprints of t1 produced in Step 2d and the output of 06a as input for the process.

The following variables are computed: 

* TARGET_FID : Identifier building
* area_foot: Size of building footprint
* peri_foot: Perimeter of building footprint
* Gebaeude_H: Building height
* VOL: Building volume (SHAPE_Area * height)       
* N_NODES: Number of nodes (vertices) in the building footprint 
* RATIOAREA: Ratio of actual footprint area to bounding rectangle area
* SHPX: Shape index of the footprint   
* UFE: Perimeter-to-area ratio
* SCHUMM: Diameter of circle with the same area / Diameter of smalles circumscribing circle   
* N_NBR: Number of neighbours  
* MBG_Width: Width of the minimum bounding rectangle       
* MBG_Length: Length of the minimum bounding rectangle  
* MBG_Orientation: Orientation (angle) of the rectangle  
* RECTRATIO: Ratio of rectangle's length to width (MBG_Length / MBG_Width)
* AREARECT: Area of the bounding rectangle (MBG_Length * MBG_Width)  
* MBG_Diameter: Diameter of the minimum bounding circle  

* NEAR_FID: Object ID of the nearest feature     
* MINDISTROAD: Distance from building to nearest road street axis      
* MINDISTBLDG: Distance to nearest neighboring building  

* ADDNUMB: Count of address points intersecting with building   
  
* OID_REG: Unique identifier for building region (touching footprints dissolved) 
* AREAREG: Area of the building region       
* PERIREG: Perimeter of building region 
* SHPXREG: Shape index of the building region  
* MIN_AREA, MAX_AREA, MEAN_AREA, STD_AREA: Statistics for area per building region
* MIN_VOL, MAX_VOL, SUM_VOL, MEAN_VOL, STD_VOL: Statistics for volume per building region
* MIN_Gebaeude_H, MAX_Gebaeude_H, MEAN_Gebaeude_H, STD_Gebaeude_H: Statistics for buiding height per building region

* OID_BLK: Identifier for the building block  
* OBJART: ATKIS-Type of building block      
* AREA_BLK: Area of the building block polygon      
* BLK_Join_Count: Count of buildings joined to a block
* SUM_Shape_Area, MEAN_Shape_Area, STD_Shape_Area: Statistics for area of all buildings in a block
* BUILDUP: Built-up area within the block
